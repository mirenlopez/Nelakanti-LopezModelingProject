# Nelakanti-LopezModelingProject

we are developing a model to simulate 2000 patients 
over 1 year, 5 years and 10 years
We are looking to estimate the estimate a patient's mean time until stage 5 of CKD
who is in stage 1 of CKD at the beginning of the simulation time

STEP 1
Running 2000 patients to see survival time for a patient in state well
